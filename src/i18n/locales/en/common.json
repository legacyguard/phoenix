      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?",
        "answer": "After canceling, your data remains securely stored in read-only mode for 90 days. You can reactivate your subscription anytime within this period to regain full access. After 90 days, your data will be securely and permanently deleted from our systems."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What is a 'Guardian'?",
        "answer": "A Guardian is someone you trust (e.g., a partner, sibling, or legal professional) whom you grant special, limited access to your information for emergencies. They cannot change your data; they can only view it to act on your instructions."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What's the difference between the 'Vault' and the 'Manual'?",
        "answer": "The Heritage Vault is where you securely store all your important papers and things you own. The Survivor's Manual is a curated selection of the most critical contacts, papers, and instructions from your vault, designed for your trusted helpers to have everything essential in one place."

        "question": "Is a will created in LegacyGuard legally binding?",
        "answer": "LegacyGuard helps you prepare and organize all the groundwork and information for your will. However, in most European countries, the digital document does not replace the need for an official, signed (and often notarized) document. We recommend always consulting the final version with a legal professional."
