### Potential Missing Dependencies

Based on the empty feature directories, you might need:
- Document management libraries (if not using Supabase storage)
- PDF generation libraries for will/document export
- Video/audio recording libraries (beyond the basic implementation)
- Calendar/scheduling libraries for consultations
- Real-time communication libraries if needed

## 3. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Consolidate Feature Structure**: Move existing components from `src/components/` and `src/pages/` into their respective feature directories for better organization.

2. **Create Missing Feature Modules**: For each empty feature directory, create:
   - An index.ts/tsx file
   - Main feature component
   - Sub-components folder
   - Types/interfaces file
   - Tests folder

3. **Feature Implementation Priority**:
   - **High Priority**: Authentication flow, Documents management, Dashboard enhancement
   - **Medium Priority**: Legal Consultations, Executor Toolkit, Time Capsule
   - **Low Priority**: Legacy Briefing (seems partially implemented)

4. **Dependencies to Consider Adding**:
   - `react-pdf` or `jspdf` - For PDF generation/viewing
   - `react-dropzone` - For better file uploads
   - `date-fns` is already included ✅
   - `react-big-calendar` - For consultation scheduling
   - `socket.io-client` - If real-time features needed

### Code Organization Suggestions:

1. Create a consistent structure for each feature:
   ```
   src/features/[feature-name]/
   ├── index.ts
   ├── components/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── services/
   ├── types/
   └── tests/
   ```

2. Implement lazy loading for all feature modules (already done for some routes ✅)

3. Create shared types/interfaces for cross-feature communication

4. Consider implementing a feature flag system using the existing GrowthBook integration

## 4. Dependencies Health Check

All dependencies appear to be up-to-date with recent versions. The project uses:
- Modern React 18
- Latest UI libraries
- Current authentication and payment solutions
- Active database and backend services

No critical security vulnerabilities or deprecated packages were identified in the current dependency list.
