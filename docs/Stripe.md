**Your Immediate Next Steps**

You are now ready to complete the Stripe verification process. The next steps are manual and straightforward.

**Step 1: Populate the Placeholder Content**

-   This is the most important manual task. You must replace the **[Insert your ... text here]** placeholders with real content.

-   **For the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:** You can use online template generators as a starting point (search for "SaaS Terms of Service generator" or "GDPR Privacy Policy generator"). **Crucially, you must have a legal professional review these before you launch to real customers.** For the purpose of Stripe's *initial verification*, a comprehensive template is usually sufficient.

-   **For the Refund Policy:** Be clear and decisive. A simple statement like, "Due to the nature of our digital service, we do not offer refunds on subscription payments. You may cancel your subscription at any time, and you will retain access to premium features until the end of your current billing period," is a common and acceptable policy.

**Step 2: Submit Your Website to Stripe**

-   Log in to your Stripe Dashboard.

-   Navigate to the section where it asks for your business details and website.

-   Enter the URL of your main landing page (e.g., **https://legacyguard.eu** ).

-   Submit the information for review.

**Step 3: Wait for Approval**

-   Stripe's review process is usually quite fast, often taking anywhere from a few hours to a couple of business days. Their automated systems will crawl your site, find the footer, and verify that the links to your Pricing, Terms, Privacy, and Refund policies are present and contain relevant content.

**Conclusion**

You have done everything right. You've built the necessary public-facing infrastructure quickly and professionally. Once you populate the placeholder text, you will have everything you need to pass Stripe's verification.

While you wait for Stripe's approval, you can confidently proceed with the final **"Production Hardening"** phase (the checklist from Prompt PH.1), knowing that your payment infrastructure is being sorted out in parallel. You are on the final stretch before being ready to launch.
