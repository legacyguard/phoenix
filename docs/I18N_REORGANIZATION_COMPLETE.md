## Conclusion

The i18n reorganization has been completed successfully! The massive `common.json` file has been completely eliminated and replaced with a proper modular structure that provides:

- **Better performance** through selective loading
- **Improved maintainability** with focused files
- **Enhanced developer experience** with clear organization
- **Better translation quality** with context-specific grouping
- **True scalability** for future development

The application now has a robust, modular i18n system that will scale efficiently as the application grows and provide a much better experience for both developers and translators.
