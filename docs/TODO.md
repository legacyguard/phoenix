    -   [X] Finalize and commit `db-schema.md`.
    -   [X] Finalize and commit `api-schema.md`.

    -   [ ] Move the existing React app into `/apps/frontend`.
    -   [ ] Ensure it works correctly within the monorepo setup.
    -   [ ] Configure it to import from the shared `/packages/types` directory.
