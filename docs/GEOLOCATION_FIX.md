# Geolocation Fix Summary

## Problem
The country/language selection modal was defaulting to Germany ('DE') when no country was detected, instead of properly detecting the user's location based on their IP address.

## Root Cause
In `src/components/modals/CountryLanguageModal.tsx`, line 48 had a hardcoded default:
```typescript
const [selectedCountry, setSelectedCountry] = useState<CountryCode>(
  detectedCountry || 'DE'  // Hardcoded to Germany
);
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Hardcoded Default
Updated the component to not default to any country if detection fails:
```typescript
const [selectedCountry, setSelectedCountry] = useState<CountryCode | ''>(
  detectedCountry || ''  // Let user choose if no detection
);
```

### 2. Added Proper Country Update Hook
Added a useEffect to update the selected country when detection completes:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (detectedCountry) {
    setSelectedCountry(detectedCountry);
  }
}, [detectedCountry]);
```

### 3. Fixed UI Display
- Updated the country selector to show placeholder text when no country is selected
- Updated button validation to require both country AND language selection
- Fixed domain suggestion display to handle empty country state

### 4. Created Cache Clearing Utilities
- Created `src/utils/clearGeoCache.ts` with functions to clear geolocation cache
- Created `docs/clear-geo-cache.js` - a script to run in browser console

## How to Test

1. Clear your browser's localStorage cache by running this in the console:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('geolocation_data');
   localStorage.removeItem('user_country_language_preferences');
   ```

2. Refresh the page

3. The app should now:
   - Detect your actual location (Czech Republic based on your IP)
   - Show "We detected you are in Czech Republic" in the modal
   - Pre-select Czech Republic in the country dropdown
   - Show appropriate language options for Czech Republic

## Additional Notes

- The geolocation service uses `https://ipapi.co/json/` for IP-based location detection
- Results are cached for 24 hours to avoid excessive API calls
- If detection fails, users can manually select their country
- The fix ensures no hardcoded defaults affect the user experience

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/modals/CountryLanguageModal.tsx` - Removed hardcoded default, added proper state handling
2. `/src/utils/clearGeoCache.ts` - New utility for cache management
3. `/docs/clear-geo-cache.js` - Browser console script for testing
4. `/docs/GEOLOCATION_FIX.md` - This documentation
