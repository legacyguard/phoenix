# Console Warnings and Fixes

## Summary of Issues Resolved

### 1. React Router v7 Future Flags Warnings
**Issue:** React Router was showing warnings about upcoming v7 changes:
- `v7_startTransition` - State updates will use React.startTransition
- `v7_relativeSplatPath` - Changes to relative path matching for splat routes

**Solution:** 
- Enabled future flags in `BrowserRouter` configuration in `App.tsx`
- Added `future={{ v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true }}`

### 2. Missing i18n Namespace
**Issue:** The `onboarding` namespace was not registered in the i18n configuration, causing HTML 404 responses when trying to load translation files.

**Solution:**
- Added `'onboarding'` to the namespaces array in `src/i18n/i18n.ts`

### 3. Clerk Development Keys Warning
**Issue:** Clerk was warning about using development keys (pk_test_*) which have usage limits.

**Solution:**
- Created `src/utils/env-check.ts` for environment configuration validation
- Added logging to detect development vs production key usage
- Provides clear warnings when configuration mismatches are detected

## Files Modified

1. **src/App.tsx**
   - Added React Router future flags
   - Imported and called `logEnvironmentInfo()` for development debugging

2. **src/i18n/i18n.ts**
   - Added `'onboarding'` to the namespaces array

3. **src/utils/env-check.ts** (New file)
   - Environment configuration checker
   - Detects Clerk key type (development/production)
   - Provides configuration warnings

## Remaining Non-Critical Warnings

### Browser Extension Related
- `Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response...`
  - This is caused by browser extensions (likely password managers or ad blockers)
  - Not related to application code
  - Can be ignored in development

### Expected Warnings
- Clerk development keys warning is expected in development
- Will disappear when production keys are configured for production deployment

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. ✅ Update Clerk keys from `pk_test_*` to `pk_live_*`
2. ✅ Update Clerk secret key from `sk_test_*` to `sk_live_*`
3. ✅ Configure production Supabase URL and keys
4. ✅ Set up production Stripe keys if payment processing is enabled
5. ✅ Generate and configure production encryption keys
6. ✅ Update all webhook secrets for production endpoints

## Environment Variables Reference

Key environment variables to update for production:

```env
# Clerk (Production)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# Stripe (Production)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# Application
VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_IS_PRODUCTION=true
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. React Router warnings should no longer appear in the console
2. The onboarding namespace should load without HTML response errors
3. Environment configuration will be logged in development mode
4. Professional dashboard can be enabled via:
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard?professional=true`
   - LocalStorage: `localStorage.setItem('useProfessionalDashboard', 'true')`

## Additional Notes

- The environment checker (`env-check.ts`) only logs in development mode
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes were introduced
- The application remains fully functional with these improvements
