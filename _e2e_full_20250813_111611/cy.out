âš  Warning: It looks like you're passing --spec a space-separated list of arguments:

"cypress/e2e/00_simple_visit.cy.ts cypress/e2e/01_onboarding_dashboard.cy.ts cypress/e2e/02_scan_to_vault.cy.ts cypress/e2e/03_will_pdf.cy.ts cypress/e2e/04_time_capsule.cy.ts cypress/e2e/05_dead_man_switch.cy.ts"

This will work, but it's not recommended.

If you are trying to pass multiple arguments, separate them with commas instead:
  cypress run --spec arg1,arg2,arg3
  
The most common cause of this warning is using an unescaped glob pattern. If you are
trying to pass a glob pattern, escape it using quotes:
  cypress run --spec "**/*.spec.js"
