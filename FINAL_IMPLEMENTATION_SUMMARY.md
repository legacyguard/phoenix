## 💡 Key Design Principles

### 1. **Respectful Language**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Gamified
"You're 75% complete! Just a few more to win!"

// ✅ RIGHT: Professional
"You've secured 15 important items for your family"
```

### 2. **Status Without Percentages**
```typescript
// Instead of: "25% Complete"
// We show: "Building Foundation"

// Status progression:
- "Getting Started"
- "Building Foundation" 
- "Well Organized"
- "Comprehensive Protection"
```

### 3. **Milestones as Security Achievements**
```typescript
// Not "Level 1 Unlocked!"
// But "First Document Secured"

// Professional milestones:
- First Document: Family protection started
- Essential Protection: Core items secured
- Family Prepared: Key information organized
- Comprehensive Security: Full protection in place
```

### 4. **Task Organization**
```typescript
// Priority-based, not points-based:
- Immediate: Critical for family security
- High: Important to complete soon
- Medium: Valuable when ready
- Low: Optional enhancements
```
